LINQ: Language Integrated Query - is a uniform syntax to retrieve data from different data sources and formats viz, collections, objects, Datasets,XML docs, SQL Database and other databases

- It eliminates the mismatches between programming languages and the databases/sources, as well provide a single query interface 

- LINQ queries return results as objects
- It enables us to use OO approach on the results, and not to worry about transforming different formats to objects

select col1,col2, sum(col3) from tablename
where condition
group by col1,col2
having sum(col3)<  value
order by col2

order of sql query execution:

1. from
2. where
3. group by
4. having
5. order by
6. select

There are 2 types of Linq Query

 1. Query Expression Syntax / Query Syntax : Similar to SQL Syntax

 2. Method Syntax / Fluent Syntax / Method Extension Syntax : uses extension methods
  - Includes Lambda Expression

Linq- to -collections
Linq - to -entities
Linq-to-Sql
Linq-to-Xml
Linq-to-Datasets

-Both Query syntax and method syntax do not support all query operators. Some are supported by Query Syntax, while others are supported by Method Syntax
-Query Syntax is easier to read, but Method syntax is powerful way to write queries

Lambda Expressions :(=>) Also known as Lambda Functions. They are blocks of code that can be assigned to variables, passed as an argument or returned from a function call
- Has 2 parts. Left side is input part, Right side is expression part

Advantages of LINQ : 1. Less Coding, 2 . Readable Code, 3. Standardised way of querying, 4. Compile time safety of queries,5. Intellisense Support 


Linq queries have 2 types of behaviours 1. immediate and 2. deferred (default)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Deferred                                                   vs                        Immediate

-query is not executed at the point of Declaration							Query is executed at the point of its declaration
-Projection Operators- Select,SelectMany									Aggregation - Count,Avg,sum
Restriction Operators: Where												Element Operators: First,Last,ToArray,ToList
Paging Operator :Take,Skip 
- Lazy Operators														Greedy Operators

-Avoids Unnecessary query execution and hence improves performance
-Is reevaluated whenever we re-enumerate, thereby getting the latest of data
